Task:

Each team must prepare a written project proposal (3-5 pages) that describes what it is they are going
to build. The proposal should describe the purpose of the product you plan to build, and give a brief
description of how it will be used and how it will work. You do not have to go in to any detail about how
it will be designed but briefly discuss the major components you plan to include in it. It should include a
block diagram of the project showing how the major components are interconnected. It should not include
any detailed schematic diagrams or descriptions of the software or of the circuit on a gate level.
An important part of the proposal is a time-line schedule showing when each project task is to be
completed: designing, simulating (if applicable), assembling and testing of each module, and integration of
the modules. This timeline should include all the major tasks that the team will have to work on during the
semester right through the writing of the final report.
